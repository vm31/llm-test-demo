**Business Requirement Document (BRD) for ABN AMRO User Login Functionality**

**Introduction**

ABN AMRO's website provides various online banking and financial services to its customers. The login
functionality is a critical aspect of the website, allowing users to access their accounts, view transactions, and
manage their finances securely. This BRD outlines the requirements for improving the user login functionality of
the ABN AMRO website.

**Business Objectives**

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. To enhance the security and reliability of the login process.
2. To simplify the login experience for users.
3. To reduce the number of password reset requests.
4. To improve the overall user satisfaction with the online banking platform.

**Functional Requirements**

username/password, mobile app, etc.).
        * Ensure the login form is accessible on various devices and screen sizes.
2. **Authentication Methods**
        * Support multiple authentication methods, including:
                + Password-based login
                + Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using a mobile app or SMS
                + Biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint recognition)
3. **User Profile Management**
        * Allow users to update their profile information, such as name, email address, and password.
        * Ensure that user profile changes are reflected in the login process.
4. **Password Reset**

        * Send password reset instructions via email or SMS, as preferred by the user.
5. **Security Measures**
        * Enforce robust security measures, including:
                + HTTPS encryption
                + Secure token storage (e.g., cookies)
                + Regular security updates and patches
6. **Error Handling and Feedback**
        * Implement error handling mechanisms to provide clear and concise feedback to users in case of login failures or
other errors.
        * Display a countdown timer for password resets to reduce wait times.

**Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Performance**
        * Ensure the login functionality loads within 3 seconds.
        * Support a minimum of 100 concurrent user sessions simultaneously.
2. **Usability**
        * Achieve an average user satisfaction rating of 90% or higher.
        * Conduct regular usability testing to identify areas for improvement.
3. **Accessibility**
        * Ensure the login functionality meets the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 level AA.

**User Experience Requirements**

1. **Intuitive Interface**
        * Design an intuitive interface that allows users to easily navigate and complete the login process.
        * Use clear and concise language in all login-related communications.
2. **Personalization**
        * Allow users to customize their login experience, such as setting a custom password or using biometric authenti

authentication.
3. **Security Awareness**
        * Educate users on the importance of online security and provide tips for maintaining secure passwords and account
information.

**Technical Requirements**

1. **Programming Languages**
        * Develop the login functionality in [list programming languages].
