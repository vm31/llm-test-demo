User Requirements
User requirements are a subset of functional requirements that address the needs and expectations of the end users. These are derived from understanding the goals, tasks, and workflows of the users.

Focus on the specific functionalities that users expect from the system or software. They are typically expressed in user-friendly language and are often documented using techniques such as use cases or user stories.

For example, in a banking application, some user requirements could include:

Create a new account: Users should be able to create a new account by providing the necessary information.
Update account information: Should be able to update their account details, such as contact information or password.
Perform transactions: Should be able to perform various transactions, such as deposits, withdrawals, or transfers.
