- Ensure compatibility with desktop and mobile devices.  
- Maintain data security and user privacy in compliance with industry standards.  

---

#### **3. Scope**  
The scope of this functionality includes:  
- A user interface for entering login credentials.  
- Backend integration for user authentication.  
- Error handling and appropriate user feedback.  

---

#### **4. Functional Requirements**  
##### **Preconditions:**  
- User navigates to **[https://swagger.io](https://swagger.io)**.  
- User is not logged in.  

##### **Workflow Steps:**  
1. User lands on the **Swagger.io homepage**.  
2. A cookie consent pop-up appears, and the user clicks **“Allow all cookies”**.  
3. User clicks the **“Sign In”** button in the top navigation.  
4. System redirects the user to the **SmartBear authentication page** (**[https://auth.id.smartbear.com](https://auth.id.smartbear.com)**).  

##### **Post-Conditions:**  
- User is successfully redirected to **SmartBear Authentication**.

### **4.1. Login Page**  
**UI Elements:**  
- A text input field for the **email address**.  
- A text input field for the **password** (masked).  
- A **"Sign In"** button to submit credentials.  
- A **"Forgot Password"** link for password recovery.  
- A **"Sign Up"** link to navigate to the registration page.  

**Behavior:**  
- Clicking the **"Sign In"** button triggers an API call to validate user credentials.  
- If credentials are **valid**, the user is redirected to their **dashboard**.  
- If credentials are **invalid**, an error message is displayed:  
  - *"Invalid email or password. Please try again."*  
- Input fields should include **client-side validation**:  
  - Email field must follow **standard email format**.  
  - Password must be at least **8 characters**.  

---

### **4.2. Authentication API**  
- Integrate with the **Swagger.io backend** to verify credentials.  
- Ensure authentication tokens are generated and securely stored in the browser (e.g., **HTTP-only cookies**).  
- Use **industry-standard encryption protocols** for API communication (e.g., HTTPS, OAuth).  

---

### **4.3. Error Handling**  
Display a friendly error message if:  
- The **API service is unavailable**: *"Unable to connect. Please try again later."*  
- **Incorrect credentials** are entered.  
- **Required fields are left empty**: *"Please fill out all required fields."*  

---

### **4.4. Security**  
- Protect against **SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks**.  
- Lock user accounts after **five consecutive failed login attempts**.  
- Implement **CAPTCHA** for enhanced security after multiple failed attempts.  

---

#### **5. Non-Functional Requirements**  
- The system must handle **10,000 concurrent login requests**.  
- The response time for login validation should not exceed **3 seconds**.  
- Ensure **99.9% uptime** for the authentication service.  

---

#### **6. Assumptions and Dependencies**  
- Users must have an **existing account** to sign in.  
- The **backend authentication service** must be operational.  
- The **login page** will adhere to **Swagger.io’s existing design standards**.  

---

#### **7. Success Criteria**
